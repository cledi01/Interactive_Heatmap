# Interactive heatmap of various kinds of state-wide data across time
This is a repository to document the work I did for a Visualization focused
hackathon. To see the graph, npm install --> npm start.

Key files are in src/components/MapChart.js for the implementation
of the interactive map, fbidata.py for the Python script I made to automate
the collection of crime data on the state level, and notebook.ipynb for the
work I did to prepare datasets to be used in the interactive heatmap.
